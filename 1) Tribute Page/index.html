        <h2>Leader of the Azad Hind Fauj</h2>
        <p> 
             <b>Subhas Chandra Bose</b>, fondly known as Netaji, was a valiant freedom fighter and a visionary leader who played a crucial role in India's struggle for independence.
            Born on January 23, 1897, in Cuttack, Odisha, he was a charismatic nationalist who defied British rule with his unwavering determination. As the leader of the Indian National Army (INA) and the Azad Hind Government, he sought to liberate India through armed resistance. 
            His famous call, 'Give me blood, and I will give you freedom,' ignited a sense of patriotism among millions. 
            Though his mysterious disappearance in 1945 remains a subject of debate, his legacy continues to inspire generations. Netaji's courage, sacrifice, and relentless pursuit of freedom make him one of India's greatest heroes.
